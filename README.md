[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/nfsarch33/ironclaw-mcp)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/nfsarch33/ironclaw-mcp)

A production-ready **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** written in Go that bridges [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) with any MCP-compatible AI coding assistant — Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code Copilot, and more.

> **v1.0 cleanup (April 2026)**: Removed all `ironclaw_research_*`, `ironclaw_ui_*`, and `ironclaw_evolver_*` tools that wrapped the external `research-agent` CLI. `ironclaw-mcp` is now a focused IronClaw HTTP-bridge with optional CLI-driven dual-ops surfaces. Scraper, browser-automation, and evolver workflows have been moved out-of-tree (see `agentic-ai-research` for replacement tooling). The pre-cleanup snapshots are archived under `~/Code/global-kb/session-handoffs/evidence/v257-w2-d0-ironclaw-mcp-cleanup/before/`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23+
- A running [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) instance

### Run with `go run`

```bash
export IRONCLAW_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
export IRONCLAW_API_KEY=your-api-key   # required when IronClaw gateway auth is enabled
go run ./cmd/ironclaw-mcp
```

### Build and run

```bash
make build
./bin/ironclaw-mcp
```

### Docker

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IRONCLAW_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | IronClaw instance URL (must be http(s); loopback-only by default) |
| `IRONCLAW_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Bearer token for the IronClaw gateway (`GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN`) when auth is enabled |
| `IRONCLAW_ALLOW_NON_LOCALHOST` | `false` | Set to `true` to allow non-loopback hosts (e.g. remote IronClaw) |
| `IRONCLAW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` | HTTP timeout in seconds (1–120) |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `stdio` or `sse` |
| `MCP_SSE_ADDR` | `:8080` | Bind address when using SSE |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

**Secure local defaults:** By default, `IRONCLAW_BASE_URL` is restricted to loopback addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). Set `IRONCLAW_ALLOW_NON_LOCALHOST=true` only when you explicitly need to connect to a remote IronClaw instance.

## Cursor / Claude Code Integration

Add to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or Claude Code config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ironclaw": {
      "command": "/path/to/bin/ironclaw-mcp",
      "env": {
        "IRONCLAW_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "IRONCLAW_API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or with Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ironclaw": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "IRONCLAW_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000",
        "ironclaw-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
# Full check (tidy + fmt + vet + lint + test)
make check

# Test with coverage report
make coverage

# Run linter only
make lint
```

## Local Integration Path (Cursor + IronClaw)

The supported local setup for Cursor integration:

1. **IronClaw runtime** — bound to loopback (`GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1`, default)
2. **ironclaw-mcp bridge** — stdio transport in Cursor, `IRONCLAW_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
3. **Minimal config** — `~/.cursor/mcp.json` with `command` and `IRONCLAW_API_KEY` whenever the gateway is protected by `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN`

### Smoke Test Workflow

1. Start IronClaw with loopback-first settings (gateway on `http://localhost:3000`)
2. Export `IRONCLAW_API_KEY` if the gateway is protected by `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Run `make smoke` for the gateway-only proof, or `SMOKE_STATEFUL_TOOL=ironclaw_chat make smoke` for the full local chat-path proof
4. The harness verifies:
   - IronClaw gateway `/api/health`
   - Router `/healthz` and `/v1/models` when the chat-path proof is requested
   - MCP `initialize`
   - MCP `tools/list`
   - `ironclaw_health`
   - One configurable stateful tool (`ironclaw_list_jobs` by default, or `SMOKE_STATEFUL_TOOL=ironclaw_chat`)
5. Add `ironclaw-mcp` to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and reload MCP servers

#### `--all` and `--report` flags

```bash
# Test all 14 base tools (15 with PROMETHEUS_URL) with deterministic payloads
make smoke SMOKE_ARGS="--all"

# Get JSON test results (pipe to jq, CI artifacts, etc.)
./scripts/smoke-test.sh --all --report

# JSON output includes per-tool pass/fail/skip status and timing
./scripts/smoke-test.sh --all --report | jq '.summary'
```

The `--all` flag exercises every tool with safe, deterministic payloads (destructive tools like `ironclaw_delete_routine` and slow tools like `ironclaw_chat` are skipped with documented reasons). The `--report` flag outputs a structured JSON report suitable for CI pipelines.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused**: Ensure IronClaw is running and bound to localhost:3000
- **Router health check fails**: Ensure `llm-cluster-router` is listening on `SMOKE_ROUTER_URL` and the local upstreams have finished model load
- **Expected model missing from `/v1/models`**: Check the router config and make sure the primary `qwen3.5-27b` upstream is healthy before re-running chat smoke
- **401 Unauthorized**: Set `IRONCLAW_API_KEY` to the token printed by IronClaw at startup (or `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` if you set it)
- **Non-loopback URL rejected**: Use `IRONCLAW_ALLOW_NON_LOCALHOST=true` only when connecting to a remote IronClaw instance
- **Chat appears asynchronous**: `ironclaw-mcp` now polls IronClaw thread history after `/api/chat/send`; if the local model is overloaded or unavailable, the tool call can time out instead of returning a partial response
- **Need a full chat-path proof**: Run `SMOKE_STATEFUL_TOOL=ironclaw_chat make smoke` once the local router exposes `qwen3.5-27b`, or set `SMOKE_REQUIRE_ROUTER=true` to force the same router checks for a non-chat probe
